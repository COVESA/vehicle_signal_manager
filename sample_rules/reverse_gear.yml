# Reverse Gear
# When reverse gear is detected, start two monitors to ensure that we have a
# backup camera and that we are not moving forward while in reverse.
#
# We start the process by unconditionally emitting a signal, transmission.gear,
# set to 'reverse'
- emit:
    signal: transmission.gear
    value: 'reverse'

# We now monitor the incoming signal stream for specific conditions to be met.
- parallel:
    - condition: transmission.gear == 'reverse'
      # When this monitor's condition (gear in reverse) becomes true, a signal
      # will be emitted to turn the backup light.
      emit:
        # Emit a signal to turn on the backup light when the hosting condition
        # becomes true.
        #
        # We can emit signals when the condition becomes false, or always
        # (both when true and false)
        when: always
        # How many msec to wait after condition changes before we emit the
        # signal.
        delay: 100

        # Which signal to emit
        signal: lights.external.backup

        # The value emitted can be a generic expression
        value: camera.backup.active

      # All monitors under the 'parallel:' element will be activated in
      # parallel.
      #
      # If one monitor condition becomes true it will activate its child
      # monitors and execute its emits. If, subsequenctly, a second monitor
      # hosted under the same 'parallel:' element also becomes true it will
      # also activate its child monitors and emits independently of the first
      # one.
      # If you want to deactivate the other monitors under a 'parallel:'
      # element as soon as a specific one evaluates to true, insert the
      # 'break:' tag somewhere into the monitor that should preempt the others.
      # This will trigger one and only one of the monitors under a 'parallel:'
      # element.

        # vehicle being put in reverse.

        # active, or when the parent condition becomes false.
