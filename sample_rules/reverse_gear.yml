# Reverse Gear
# When reverse gear is detected, start two monitors to ensure that we have a
# backup camera and that we are not moving forward while in reverse.
#
# We start the process by unconditionally emitting a signal, transmission.gear,
# set to 'reverse'
emit:
    signal: transmission.gear
    value: 'reverse'

# We now monitor the incoming signal stream for specific conditions to be met.
parallel:
    - condition: transmission.gear == 'reverse'
      # When this monitor's condition (gear in reverse) becomes true, a signal
      # will be emitted to turn the backup light.
      emit:
        # Emit a signal to turn on the backup light when the hosting condition
        # becomes true.
        #
        # We can emit signals when the condition becomes false, or always
        # (both when true and false)
        when: always
        # How many msec to wait after condition changes before we emit the
        # signal.
        delay: 100

        # Which signal to emit
        signal: lights.external.backup

        # The value emitted can be a generic expression
        value: camera.backup.active

      # All monitors under the 'parallel:' element will be activated in
      # parallel.
      #
      # If one monitor condition becomes true it will activate its child
      # monitors and execute its emits. If, subsequenctly, a second monitor
      # hosted under the same 'parallel:' element also becomes true it will
      # also activate its child monitors and emits independently of the first
      # one.
      # If you want to deactivate the other monitors under a 'parallel:'
      # element as soon as a specific one evaluates to true, insert the
      # 'break:' tag somewhere into the monitor that should preempt the others.
      # This will trigger one and only one of the monitors under a 'parallel:'
      # element.
      parallel:

        # We want to see the backup camera being active within 100 msec of the
        # vehicle being put in reverse.
        #
        # This monitor will be active from 'start' msec after it becomes
        # active, or when the parent condition becomes false.
        - condition: camera.backup.active == true

          # How many msec do we wait after parent condition becomes true
          # (gear = reverse) until we require our condition (backup camera
          # active) to also be true.
          start: 100

          # How many msec after activation do we keep the monitor active?
          # The monitor condition has to remain true for 'stop' milliseconds
          # after the monitor is started. If those criteria are not fulfilled,
          # an error will be logged
          stop: 1000

          # Use the 'sequence:' element if you want a specific set of
          # conditions to become true in a given sequence. The same effect
          # can be achieved by nesting a number of confitions inside each
          # other, but a 'sequence:' keyword greatly eases readability
          sequence:
            # We first want the backup radar to become active.
            - condition: radar.backup.active == true

              start: 200

              # The monitor, once started, remains active until the parent
              # condition (backup camera active) becomes false.
              stop: 0
            
              # Once the backup radar is active, we then want the backup camera
              # application to be active.
            - condition: ivi.application.back_up_camera.active == true
              # Give the backup app 100 ms to become active
              start: 100

              # The monitor, once started, remains active until the parent
              # condition (backup camera active) becomes false.
              stop: 0

        # For as long as the gear is in reverse, we want to ensure that the
        # vehicle is standing still or moving forward.
        #
        # Since both the backup camera and transmission speed condition
        # are hosted under a 'parallel:' element, both the backup camera
        # and transmission speed will be monitored simultaneously.
        #
        # If the backup camera becomes active, and that monitor in its turn
        # starts monitoring for the backup radar and IVI app sequence, the
        # transmission speed will still be monitored to ensure that the
        # vehicle is only moving backwards.
        - condition: transmission.speed <= 0
          # Car may still be rolling forward as reverse is engaged.
          # Wait 1000 msec before activating monitor.

          # condition (gear = reversed) becomes false.
